REVIEW ANSWERS

1. group multiple variables together in a single record, associate functions with that group of data,
can use inheritance which allows us to take a base set of code and extend it without
having to rewrite it from scratch.

2. 'class'

3. start with upper-case

4. comments go after the creation of the class, class Name: (next line after put comments, before 
def __init__(self):). use """ triple quote comments, to make it easier for you and others to 
reference your code

5. they are the same except function is out of a class and method is in a class

6. instance variable, attribute, field

7. magic method is __init__ (initialization method, called automatically)

8. dunder = double underscores = magic method

9. start with (self) parameter

10. the __init__ method

11. self.

12. constructor is the init method

13. class code defines a class, object calls the class and creates an instance of it

14. forgetting to use () after calling the class ( Class() ), specifying which instance you are
calling when using a class. (with which variable)

15. by using the variable.attribute to assign the attribute

16. to find errors using mypy, which can tell you when an incorrect type has been used

17. dataclass simplifies your code when your __init__ method is only going to take in data
